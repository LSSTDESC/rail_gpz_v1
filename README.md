# rail_gpz_v1
RAIL interface to Peter Hatfield's python 3 port of the GPz v1 algorithm.  A slight modification of Peter's code found here: `https://github.com/pwhatfield/GPz_py3` which is itself adapted from Ibrahim Almosallam's original implementation here: `https://github.com/OxfordML/GPz` (in Matlab).  If subsequent versions of GPz with either improved features or faster performance are made available then they may replace this version.
